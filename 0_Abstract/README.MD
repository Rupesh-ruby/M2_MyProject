## ABSTRACT
 LED and Buzzer indication as the name suggest , the sensor that detects when the blink needs to sound make.
 When the sensor detects a cue , it then the signal to the countinue blink leds
operating mechanism. After receiving that signal , . Most of the led sensor PIR Sensor is used. 
The PIR sensor is used to open or close the blink automatically which senses the infrared energy produced by the human body,
the IR energy sensed by the PIR Sensor changes and activates the sensors

NOTE : My project is adout Door Detector with LED and Buzzer indication in my project i implement the switch instead of using PIR Sensor,because in SimulIDE platform there is no available of the PIR Sensor.so i use switch incase of using the PIR Sensor.
