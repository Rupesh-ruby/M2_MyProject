# Flashing Of led's and Turing on and off of Burzzer


* The blinking LED circuit is like the electronics version of the “Hello World”-program. It’s a simple electronic circuit that gives you a visual cue if it works. It was the first circuit I ever built, and it felt GREAT!

* The goal is to make a Light Emitting Diode (LED) flashing and blink into buzzer sound.

# Appplication 

This is a circuit in which an LED will blink on and off, on and off, on and off, repeatedly, forever until stopped by the user such as by shutting it off.

As with pretty much all the AVR projects we do, we will use the popular ATmega328 chip.

This chip is completely compatible with the ATmega168  so that chip can be used as well. All the pins (the pin layout) are exactly the same.

Our circuit will be very simple. We will blink a single LED on and off. It will be on for a second, then shut off for a second, then turn back on for a second, then shut off for a second, and repeat this seemingly forever.

Of course you can adjust the time interval but 1 second is pretty standard.
